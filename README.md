# PlatformIO Remote Debugging (with Serial Wire Viewer)

This repository contains a PlatformIO project for the STM32 "Blue pill" development board, based around the STM32F103 microcontroller.

The project demonstrates the use of the ITM and SWO modules within ARM's Coresight debug hardware to provide printf services to a debugging host.

For more information see my blog entry [PlatformIO & ARM's ITM/SWO (Serial Wire Viewer)](https://www.quantulum.co.uk/blog/platformio-arm-itm-swo-serial-wire-viewer).

It additionally demonstrates how to have PlatformIO debug a board connected to a remote host running OpenOCD.
